# Orbital-Plotting-and-Parametric-Analysis-of-Stochastic-Differential-Equations

In this paper, MATLAB is used as a tool to draw multiple Brownian motion (BM)
orbits with different parameters by means of a fixed-step Markov chain. After obtaining the Brownian
motion model, this paper once again uses the method of a fixed-step Markov chain to obtain the
solutions of univariate and multivariate stochastic differential equations, and explores the influence of
the parameters on the orbit. Finally, this paper uses the Monte Carlo method to calculate the expectation
and variance of the solutions.
